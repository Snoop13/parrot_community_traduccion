<h3>[SOLVED] Background,internet connection problem</h3>
<div class="postmsg">
<p>Hi guys,</p><p>So I am pretty new to Linux in general, and this is my first time using Linux as primary OS.<br/>I decided to give a try to Parrot.<br/>So I installed I think it was 2.5 back then, everything was working fine, which is important I was using VPN to connect to a network.<br/>One day out of sudden my Internet connection stopped to work, but what is interesting through VPN it was working just fine.<br/>And then folder background changed, which is nothing more but annoying.<br/>So as there was Internet connection problem I decided to reinstall whole system.<br/>And just the next day the same problem came back, background color changed, Internet stopped working, even through VPN.<br/>Then I decided to install Parrot Lite, but even here the same problem occurred.<br/>There is a screen shot that explain exactly how my background color problem look like. - <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wlNvr" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/wlNvr</a></p><p>So what am I doing wrong?<br/>For a moment I thought that it is maybe because I am using apt-get upgrade, but with Parrot Lite I only used update and dist-upgrade, and problem occurred anyway, so I have no clue what is causing this.<br/>I am downloading Parrot once again, and I will try to reinstall today once again.</p><br/><p>Yesterday I also accidentally formated my external HDD, by using DD (I disconnected is as fast as I realised what I did).<br/>So I am using ddrescue and testdisk, to rescue as much as I can, would you recommend anything else to try?</p>

<h3>Re: [SOLVED] Background,internet connection problem</h3>
<div class="postmsg">
<p>If you are getting no DNS resolution, I had the same issue this morning too after an update.&#160; Had many weird things go bad recently after updating.&#160; Anyway, what I seen happen was my resolv.conf vanished (good thing I had a backup from messing with it one time) and was replaced by a sim link to folder in the same folder called resolvconf and to another synlink inside that folder to run which simlinks to the resolvconf folder to resolv.conf which even if I put it there doesn&#039;t work so I remove the symlink of resolv.conf and put my resolv.conf back in and I have dns resolution.<br/>Yeah, no bueno on recent updates.</p>

<p>Palinuro,<br/>you are the man!!!&#160; First off, to teniiver, you need to be more lenient on this OS.&#160; They are brand new and what they are doing is courageous not to mention innovative.&#160; When Kali first came out as Backtrack, they had their issues as well and many complaints.&#160; If you don&#039;t believe me, just look at their old forums.&#160; Second, in a lot of ways Parrot is a few steps ahead of Kali in a number of ways by having the anonsurf option, including new tools like airgeddon and atscan, and many others, and it is already on the newest 4.11 kernel!&#160; Parrot is already a contender for becoming a huge innovation for ethical hackers and pentesters everywhere.&#160; The background issue is a matter of taste and honestly I like it.&#160; I find the new background soothing and pleasing to the eye but again, a matter of taste.&#160; I really think people need to be more grateful to these prodijy developers for having the courage to start and continue such a huge undertaking and to pour their heart and soul into it.&#160; You can see the pride they take in their work in how well they designed the OS on top of Mate and the fact that they hold lots of conferences shows just how committed they are to this project.&#160; Good luck getting hold of anyone from Kali linux right away let alone have an actual founder talk to you in a forum.&#160; The fact that they even grace the forum is something you should never take for granted.&#160; While I still use Kali for some of my machines, I find Parrot&#039;s personal touch refreshing and their founders very humble and friendly since they actually take time out of development, personal life, career, and conferences just to talk with me and help me with my issues.&#160; Parrot is the most caring pentesting OS and I believe it is one that might dominate the cyber security community in the near future.&#160; I may just ditch Kali on some of my high powered machines for Parrot soon since there are even features I cannot use in Kali even with the power of GitHub.&#160; I really apologize for bringing up another OS in this forum and if I broke any rules doing so, I will understand if this message gets removed but it was well worth the cost and it needed to be said.&#160; To Palinuro and the other founders of Parrot, thank you so much for all of your hard work and effort to deliver what I believe is a godsend to the security community and words will not do it any justice.&#160; I am honored to use this OS and to be a part of such a friendly and warm community!</p>

<p>More fixing needed.<br/>I believe another way to fix the DNS issue is:<br/>sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf</p><p>I found another thing that will need to be modified.&#160; If you have an internal domain and DNS server, the head Parrot puts on your resolv.conf breaks you resolving internal DNS names.&#160; I had a field day today trying to connect to customer stuff by name today while onsite with Parrot.&#160; I had to hand blow away the Parrot and OpenDNS sections in resolv.conf and was able to resolve internal names.</p><p>So, my permanent fix was..after resolv.conf began working again..:<br/>go into /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d<br/>I then renamed head to headback.<br/>Now after a reboot, only the DNS entries for DHCP and stuff is seen.&#160; If you want the parrot DNS entries, I advise they be placed in the tail file as I think it being in front is preventing the DNS server DHCP finds from being used.</p>

<p>PoshMagiC0de,<br/>Good looking out.&#160; I did the &#039;sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf&#039; option which to be honest, I&#039;m a little nervous about.&#160; I&#039;m not gonna do anything beyond that unless I have any issues.&#160; I know nameservers can be resolved later if needed by commenting out the parrot and just sticking with the open.&#160; Thank you for that.</p>
